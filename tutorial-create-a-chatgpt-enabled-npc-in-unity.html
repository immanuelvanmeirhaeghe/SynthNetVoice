			  <h2>Create a ChatGPT-enabled NPC in Unity</h2>
			  <p>
				  Let's start with creating a Non-Player Character (NPC) that can interact with the player in your Unity game.  First, we'll need to set up the environment. Here are the tools you'll need:
				  <ul>
					  <li>Unity: a game engine used to create 2D and 3D games</li>
					  <li>Visual Studio (or another code editor): to write and edit scripts for your game
					  <li>Github: a version control system to store and manage your code
				  </ul>
				  Once you have these tools set up, you're ready to create your NPC.
			  </p>

			  <div>
				  <h3>Step 1: Create a new GameObject</h3>
				  <p>
					  In Unity, create a new GameObject by right-clicking in the Hierarchy window and selecting "Create Empty." Name the object "NPC."
				  </p>
			  </div>
			  <div>
				  <h3>Step 2: Add a collider and rigidbody</h3>
				  <p>
					  To enable interactions with the player, your NPC needs a collider and rigidbody. Add a collider by clicking "Add Component" in the Inspector window and selecting "Box Collider." Then, add a rigidbody by selecting "Rigidbody" from the same menu.
				  </p>
			  </div>
			  <div>
				  <h3>Step 3: Write the NPC script</h3>
				  <p>
					  Now it's time to write the script that will control your NPC's behavior. In Visual Studio, create a new C# script called "NPC" and attach it to the "NPC" GameObject in Unity. Here's some sample code to get you started:
					  <code class="container">
						  using System.Collections;
						  using System.Collections.Generic;
						  using UnityEngine;
						  public class NPC : MonoBehaviour
						  {
						  public float moveSpeed = 5f;
						  public float rotateSpeed = 5f;
						  private Transform player;
						  void Start()
						  {
						  player = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Player").transform;
						  }
						  void Update()
						  {
						  // Rotate towards the player
						  transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(transform.rotation, Quaternion.LookRotation(player.position - transform.position), rotateSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
						  // Move towards the player
						  transform.position += transform.forward * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
						  }
						  }
					  </code>
					  This code will make your NPC rotate and move towards the player. You can customize the moveSpeed and rotateSpeed variables to adjust the NPC's behavior.
				  </p>
			  </div>
			  <div>
				  <h3>Step 4: Test your NPC</h3>
				  <p>
					  Save the script and return to Unity. Press the play button to test your game. You should see your NPC move towards the player and rotate to face them.
				  </p>
			  </div>

				  <h3>Step 5: How to implement ChatGPT bots in your game with some code samples.</h3>
				  <p>
					  First, you'll need to choose a ChatGPT API to use. There are several available, such as GPT-3 by OpenAI or DialoGPT by Microsoft. Once you have an API key, you can start integrating the ChatGPT bot into your game.Here's an example of how to integrate a ChatGPT bot into a Unity game:
					  <code class="container">
						  using System.Collections;
						  using System.Collections.Generic;
						  using UnityEngine;
						  using UnityEngine.Networking;
						  public class ChatGPT : MonoBehaviour
						  {
						  public string apiKey;
						  public string botId;
						  public string conversationId;
						  public string message;
						  private string baseUrl = "https://api.api.ai/v1/query?v=20150910";
						  public void SendMessage()
						  {
						  StartCoroutine(PostMessage());
						  }
						  IEnumerator PostMessage()
						  {
						  string url = baseUrl + "&query=" + message + "&lang=en";
						  UnityWebRequest www = UnityWebRequest.Get(url);
						  www.SetRequestHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + apiKey);
						  www.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
						  www.SetRequestHeader("Accept", "application/json");
						  yield return www.SendWebRequest();
						  if (www.result != UnityWebRequest.Result.Success)
						  {
						  Debug.Log(www.error);
						  }
						  else
						  {
						  string response = www.downloadHandler.text;
						  Debug.Log(response);
						  }
						  }
						  }
					  </code>
					  In this example, we're using the API.AI API to send messages to a ChatGPT bot. To use this script, you'll need to replace the apiKey, botId, and conversationId variables with your own values.
				  </p>

			  <div>
				  <h3>Step 6: Test.</h3>
				  <p>
					  Save the script and return to Unity. Press the play button to test your game. Congratulations, you've created an NPC with basic AI functionality! This is just the beginning - there are many ways to enhance and customize your NPC's behavior using more complex AI techniques.
