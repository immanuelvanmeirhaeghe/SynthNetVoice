# SynthNetVoice
SynthNetVoice is an ASP.NET Core Web API for Windows-only TTS. To perform text-to-speech, a speech synthesis engine that supports your language-country code must be installed.

## Info
SynthNetVoice is an ASP.NET Core Web API that I developed as a prototype and poc. It demonstrates a Fallout 4 NPC simulator using Windows TTS and ChatGPT, connecting with the official OpenAI API.

## Requirements
Works only for Windows text-to-speech (TTS). To perform TTS, a speech synthesis engine that supports your language-country code must be installed.
You will need [to register an account with OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account) to get an api key and organization id to configure the application in appsettings.json
